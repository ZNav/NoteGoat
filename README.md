# NoteGoat
Created this Macro/Automation to Improve my Notetaking while in Bible Class
Utilizes .ahk and customized vivaldi to open a sidebar, search last typed infomation to lookup and open the verse.
Edit the files in settings folder to change how it operates, close and relaunch to update, or fork and use .ahk.
Syntax issue: if you try to use a modifer key for cancel input it will crash, needs read as !j in one location adn AltJ in another, refrain from using such things
